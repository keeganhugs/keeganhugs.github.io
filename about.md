I'm Keegan, a solo female digital slowmad. I work at a baller nonprofit helping election administrators run great elections. If you're here for elections content, see my Twitter and subscribe to ELECTricity. If you're here for travel stuffs, you're in the right place.

### A digital what-now? 

Slowmad!

Digital Nomads travel the world while working from their computers. They often spend a few days or weeks in a foreign city before moving on, all while freelancing or travel blogging or consulting or who-knows-what. They typically set their own hours, work from caf√©s, and obsess over minimalist travel tech.

I'm a bit different. No jetsetting for me; I'm touring the U.S. by car. I'm hardly traveling light - I mean, I have a *bread machine*. I'm not "my own boss"; I have a regular job, it's just remote. I stay in AirBnBs, and I stay for at least a month - a little slower than your typical nomad. Hence "Slowmad."

### You're doing this solo?

Yes! Why not? Solo female travelers are increasingly common, and blogs are awash with tips on how to stay safe (and stay sane) while soloing. Personally, I realized I was holding myself back waiting for a travel buddy. It's also rewarding - there's a feeling of accomplishment, of self-sufficiency.
