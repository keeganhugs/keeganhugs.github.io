title:  Summer in Chicago
---

Before officially slowmading, I get 11 days in ever-exciting Chicago. More "vacation" than "travel," this mini-adventure has been expensive, touristy, and did I mention expensive? But, hey, I only have 11 days of summer in Chicago. 

Things I'm doing/did:
* Architecture Boat Tour
* Art Institute of Chicago
* Shedd Aquarium
* Field Museum
* Second City comedy
* Drunk Shakespeare comedy
* Navy Pier (rode the wheel and watched the sunset)
* Museum of Contemporary Art
* SkyDeck (both daytime and nighttime)
* Museum of Surgical Science
* Alder Planetarium
* Museum of Science and Industry
* Southern Gothic (interactive theatre)
* Deep dish: Giordano's, Lou Malnati's, Gino's East
* Donuts: Firecakes, Stan's, Doughnut Vault
