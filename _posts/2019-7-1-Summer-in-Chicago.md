title:  Summer in Chicago
---

Before officially slowmading, I get 11 days in ever-exciting Chicago. More "vacation" than "travel," this mini-adventure has been expensive, touristy, and did I mention expensive? But, hey, I only have 11 days of summer in Chicago. 

Things I'm doing/did:
* Architecture Boat Tour
* Art Institute of Chicago
* Shedd Aquarium
* Field Museum
* Second City comedy
* Drunk Shakespeare comedy
* Navy Pier (rode the wheel and watched the sunset)
* Museum of Contemporary Art
* SkyDeck (both day and night)
* Museum of Surgical Science
* Alder Planetarium
* Museum of Science and Industry
* Southern Gothic (interactive theatre)
* Deep dish: Giordano's, Lou Malnati's, Gino's East
* Donuts: Firecakes, Stan's, Doughnut Vault

"Hold up," you might say, "Spread over 11 days, that's not much!" And you're right. I came to Chicago for a staff retreat and extended my stay, covering the extra cost myself. At the retreat's close I traded the hotel for a hostel. Previously I hated hosteling in the U.S., but Chicago has a whopping 17% hotel tax on already-pricy hotels. Thankfully HI Chicago Hostel proved my bias wrong - highly recommend. Big lockers in the room, free activities, good location.

I bought the Chicago CityPASS, which locked me in to certain activities: Shedd, Field, SkyDeck(x2), Alder, and Industry. I have mixed feelings about passes. Left to my own devices, I'd structure my trip differently - Shedd, SkyDeck(x1), Leather Archives Museum, Toby Jug Museum, the Botanic Garden, the Japanese Garden. But I was frantically doing math while queueing for Shedd. Shedd alone was 1/3 the cost of a CityPASS - and think how much VALUE I'd lose if I ever want to visit those attractions! 

"If I ever want to visit those attractions." This fomo-logic constantly trips me up. And fomo is the enemy of effective traveling. Don't get me wrong; I'm enjoying all the CityPASS unlocked. But it's about prioritization. 11 days in Chicago is. not. much. time.

Enter slowmading, the solution to "how-many-THINGS-can-I-cram-into-a-DAY" thinking. A month in Chicago would slow me down. I woudn't purchase passes that expire in a matter of days. I wouldn't make decisions in haste.
