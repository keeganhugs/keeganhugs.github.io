title: Eating Alone in Restaurants
---

As I sit alone at the bar phone-tapping this out, waiting the customary 45 minutes for Chicago deep dish, I’m surrounded entirely by graffiti. It’s a place called Gino’s East. My Chicago coworker said it’s “trying way too hard to be edgy” but that’s fine by me, because so am I.


I don’t love the social terror of eating alone in restaurants. But I’m ripping the bandaid off—deep dish not only forces me to sit alone, it forces me to sit alone a very long time. 

I’ve done Giordano’s, Lou Malnati’s, and (in-progress) Gino’s East. I was tempted to get them as take-out but I’m glad I resisted that cowardly urge. I tend towards cowardice, another habit I hope to break as a slowmad.

There’s a Netflix show called Samurai Gourmet that follows an elderly man who, finally retired, learns to eat alone in restaurants. The show links his aloneness with a new ability to truly appreciate food. Whether or not that happens for me, I’d like to emulate his courage. (He also hallucinates a drunk masterless samurai that gives life advice? Probably don’t need to emulate that.)

Pizza results are in! In order, here we go:
